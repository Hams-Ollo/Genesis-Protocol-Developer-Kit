  - "Will you implement taxonomies?"
```

### Technology Selection

For each archetype, consider these technology categories:

```yaml
core_technologies:
  - Development frameworks
  - Database systems
  - API integrations
  - Testing tools

ai_capabilities:
  - ML frameworks
  - NLP tools
  - Vector databases
  - Model serving

infrastructure:
  - Cloud platforms
  - Containerization
  - Orchestration
  - Monitoring

security:
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Encryption
  - Compliance tools
```

### Project Structure Generation

Generate appropriate directory structures based on archetype:

```yaml
common_directories:
  - src/
  - tests/
  - docs/
  - config/
  - scripts/

archetype_specific:
  alchemist:
    - experiments/
    - research/
    - models/
  sentinel:
    - security/
    - monitoring/
    - compliance/
  oracle:
    - analytics/
    - insights/
    - vectors/
  engineer:
    - architecture/
    - infrastructure/
    - workflows/
  innovator:
    - prototypes/
    - labs/
    - showcase/
  lorekeeper:
    - archives/
    - indices/
    - taxonomies/
```

### Configuration Templates

Provide archetype-specific configuration templates:

```yaml
config_files:
  - .env
  - requirements.txt
  - docker-compose.yml
  - README.md
  - setup.py
```

### Next Steps Guidance
